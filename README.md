SIMPLE FLIGHT TRAJECTORY SIMPULATOR

*Overview
This project simulates the flight of a paper plane based on user input parameters (weight, launch angle, and speed). It calculates the estimated flight distance and time using basic physics equations, and visualizes the trajectory using Python's Matplotlib library.​

*Features
- User-friendly command line interface for inputting parameters
- Calculates and displays flight time and flight distance
- Visualizes the simulated flight trajectory on a graph
- Simple error handling for invalid user input​

*Technologies/Tools Used
- Python 3.x
- matplotlib for plotting the flight trajectory
- Standard libraries: math for physics calculations

*Steps to Install & Run the Project
- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
- Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
- Install Matplotlib if not already present
- Run the program from your terminal
- Enter the requested input values in the terminal.

*Instructions for Testing
- Try different values for plane weight, launch angle, and initial speed.
- Observe the predicted flight time and distance in the terminal.
- View the trajectory graph for different scenarios.
- Input invalid values (e.g., negative numbers) to verify error handling.
