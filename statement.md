*Problem Statement
Many students are interested in understanding how flight parameters—such as weight, launch angle, and initial speed—affect the distance and duration of a paper plane's flight. However, there are limited easy-to-use digital tools that allow beginners to simulate and visualize these effects using basic physics concepts and programming.​

*Scope of the Project
This project provides a simple, interactive Python-based tool for simulating the trajectory of a paper plane. It allows the user to input key parameters, computes the estimated flight distance and time using projectile motion equations, and visually displays the flight path. The script focuses on accessibility for beginners and is designed as a single-file application.​

*Target Users
- First-year engineering and aerospace students exploring basic flight mechanics
- Beginners in programming wanting a hands-on physics project
- Educators looking for a demonstration tool for projectile motion principles​

*High-level Features
- Collects input parameters: plane weight, launch angle, and initial speed
- Computes flight time and horizontal distance using simple physics formulas
- Generates a visual plot of the plane's trajectory using Matplotlib
- Handles invalid input with clear text prompts
- Designed as a single Python script for ease of use and modification
